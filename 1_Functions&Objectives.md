# Operating System
An Operating System acts as a communication bridge (interface) between the user and computer hardware. The purpose of an operating system is to provide a platform on which a user can execute programs conveniently and efficiently.

## Objectives of Operating System
- User-friendly interface
- It ensures that the computer resources (CPU, memory, I/O devices) are utilized in an efficient manner
- It prevents unauthorized access and makes it more secure
- It coordinates and manages activities between users, devices, and programs, enabling multitasking.

## Functions of Operating System

### Process Management
- In a multi-programming environment, the OS decides the order in which processes have access to the processor, and how much processing time each process has.
- Keeps track of the status of processes.
- Allocates the CPU that is a processor to a process. 
- De-allocates processor when a process is no longer required.

### Memory Management
- The operating system manages the Primary Memory or Main Memory. 
- In multiprogramming, the OS decides the order in which processes are granted memory access, and for how long.
- It Allocates the memory to a process when the process requests it and deallocates the memory when the process has terminated or is performing an I/O operation.

### Device Management
- Keeps track of all devices connected to the system.
- There are various input and output devices. An OS controls the working of these input-output devices.
- It receives the requests from these devices, performs a specific task, and communicates back to the requesting process.

### File Management
- It keeps track of where information is stored, user access settings, the status of every file, and more.
- An OS keeps track of information regarding the creation, deletion, transfer, copy, and storage of files in an organized way.
